				<h4>My Background</h4>
				<p> As previously mentioned on the home page, I love coding. It's one of my most intimate passions that ever since I was
					about 12 years old, I knew that I wanted to do something with computers. It was only when I met a man, who back then
					was young (probably in his mid twenties), but to me he was just older. He inspired me to become a software engineer,
					when he told us one day in the backside of our old church that he was a software engineer or was going to school to
					become a software engineer or something on that order. It was later that I had to grapple myself with the decision to
					choose between software engineering and computer science. I honestly still don't really know the difference. As you
					can tell from the writing, one of my second passions is writing. I've mostly had good grades throughout my elementary
					and high school years. Writing comes natural to me and I love to write, because although I don't speak as well as I
					write, when I sit down to write, the words almost like to efficiently write themselves. Thus, it's become a beloved
					part of me. </p>

				<h4>Other Information and Experiences</h4>
				<h5>Wordpress / Web Development</h5>
				<p>I've basically taught myself through youtube tutorials and other non-youtube tutorials, I've basically taught myself
					how to code and build websites. Take this website for example, built basically from scratch mostly by html, css, and
					javascript.
				</p>
				<h5>YouVersion Product Support Volunteer</h5>
				<p>I volunteered for a time (about the space of a few months) as tech support for the biggest (likely) Christian or Bible
					app companies/churches in the world - YouVersion. It was a great experience working with lovely people who loved God
					and loved to help others. I felt very much at home with them and loved the tough yet rewarding way we got to help and
					also talk to and teach other people. I hope to come back again very soon and work with all you wonderful people.</p>
